# 📝 ToDoList

A simple and responsive To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created in my leisure time to practice DOM manipulation and event handling

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks
- Dynamically create task elements
- Delete tasks using event delegation
- Input reset after submission

## 💡 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use `querySelector` and `createElement` in JavaScript
- Attaching event listeners to dynamically created elements
- Using `event.target` and `event delegation` to manage user interactions efficiently


##Thought for the repo--

Why don't JavaScript events ever get lost?

Because they always bubble back home to their parents!
